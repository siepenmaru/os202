# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [The C Language (AKA Medieval Torture)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) <br>
The C Language is one of the most widely used programming languages. It is considered a bridge between high level languages and lower level languages, as it remains relatively user-friendly and readable compared to machine language, yet provides programmers with reasonably powerful low-level access over the machine. The C language was designed as a successor to the B programming language, and is an imperative procedural language, which means that it lacks the object-oriented features we've come to recognize in higher level object-oriented languages such as Java, C#, and Python.

2. [Security in Operating Systems](https://github.com/UI-FASILKOM-OS/SistemOperasi/blob/master/Slides/os02.pdf)<br>
Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved. This means that how we determine Security in operating systems is by measuring how well said system protects its hardware and software resources such as the CPU, Memory, Storage, etc. This is done via authorization and blocking off parts of the system that should only be accessed by certain processes or by superuser permissions.

3. [What is Privacy?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy)<br>
Privacy can have various meanings and take on a myriad of forms, however one of the definitions of privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or their information such that they are able to choose to reveal themselves selectively, and not be monitored without express permission. In the field of computers, we should keep in mind to keep various things private, such as our personal information (obviously), account passwords, and other such data that could otherwise be used for malicious purposes.

4. [What We Should Secure Ourselves Against](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware)<br>
There are many malicious individuals that can pose a threat to our systems and data. These attacks can take on many forms and attack via various means. An example of such attacks is ransomware, in which our system is breached and our data gets encrypted, then we may be forced to send payment to the attacker in order to gain access to our data.

5. [The Morris Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)<br>
The Morris worm was one of the first ever computer worms that infected systems via the internet. It was written by a graduate student at Cornell University, whom the virus was named after. Its creator claimed that the worm was originally written not to cause damage, rather to highlight certain security flaws within computer systems. However, a critical error caused the worm to spread through around 6000 UNIX machines. One of the people who helped fight the worm remarked that this showed the danger of **monoculture** in computer systems, as if all the systems on ARPANET ran on Berkeley UNIX, the worm could have disabled all fifty thousand of them. Now, the floppy disc containing the source code for the worm is stored in the Computer History Museum.

6. []()<br>
This is a section which I'm somewhat familiar with. Linux is an Operating System Kernel developed by Linus Torvalds as a fork of UNIX. To this day, there exist various distributions which utilize the linux kernel, such as Debian, Redhat, Kali, Arch, etc. The term GNU refers to a collection of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) that is widely used in Linux distributions. The topic of the linux kernel leads to the next topic,

7. Kernel<br>
The kernel is one of the key components of an operating system. Its task is to run various programs and securely access the computer's hardware. There are 4 main types of kernels: Monolithic Kernels, which has all the OS's required functionality within the kernel itself, which is best used in large servers. Then there is the Microkernel, which reduces the amount of memory required for kernel use, and is commonplace in real time systems. The Hybrid Kernel is a mix between Monolithic and Microkernel. And then there is the Exokernel, whivch solely offers process protection and resource handling.
