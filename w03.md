# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File System Basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system)<br>
File systems are systems that control how data is stored and retrieved. In the context of Operating Systems, this means that these files systems manage the structure and transference of our data. Among various file systems in use currently, the most commonly used ones are FAT & NTFS (used in windows), ext family (frequently used in linux systems), and APFS (used in macOS). These files systems may have varying advantages and disadvantages with regards to performance, overhead, etc as well as differences in how they are structured.

2. [Disk Partitioning](https://www.howtogeek.com/184659/beginner-geek-hard-disk-partitions-explained/)<br>
Disk partitions are more or less what their name says they are: turning one disk and splitting off its storage space into partitions. Each partition is treated as one file system, or volume. This comes in handy when you want to secure one volume from another via encryption, or use one partition with a certain file system and another partition with another.

3. [My Previous Experience with Disk Partitioning](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-dual-boot-mode-windows/)<br>
Back in high school, for some reason it came to my mind that I wanted to try out dual booting Linux onto my pc. During the installation process, I had to repartition the drive on my computer in order to make room for Ubuntu. This meant partitioning my drive which had more or less only one NTFS partition for windows, splitting that to make room for ext4 partitions, as NTFS is a proprietary file system by Microsoft, which Linux does not support. In total, I made 3 partitions which consisted of a root, home, and swap partition.

4. [Swap Memory](https://linuxhint.com/swap_memory_linux/)<br>
In the previous point, I mentioned a swap partition. Basically, this is a partition (or in Windows 10 and Ubuntu's case, a file) in a drive that can be used as virtual memory when for any reason your computer runs out of physical RAM. This partition is also used when you set your computer to hibernate, as all the data in your RAM is transferred into your SSD.

5. [Tar](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tar-in-linux-example-tar-gz-tar-file-and-tar-directory-and-tar-compress-commands/)<br>
Tar? As in the sticky stuff? Nope, I'm talking about archive files in linux. Tar apparently stands for "tape archive", and serves to bundle multiple files into one neat file (i.e. a tarball). This is somewhat different to a zip file, where the files are also compressed in addition to being bundled. However you can also compress tarballs with gzip, resulting in a .tar.gz file.

6. [Make](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/umake.htm)<br>
Make (that's what it's called) is a utility used for building and maintaining groups of programs from source code. In this week's demo, I got to try the make command on a file which I extracted from a tarball. This make utility also determines which pieces of the program need to be recompiled, and tells the system to do so.

7. [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux)<br>
Okay, I'm gonna go on a bit of a tangent here, but I found this interesting. From what I can gather, Arch Linux is a distribution of GNU/Linux which users install via the CLI nearly from scratch. Modern operating systems that most people use include various programs for ease of use like a graphical file explorer, a desktop environment and window manager, etc. Arch scraps all of that in favor of installing each utility on demand as to keep all the control to the user and reduce any unnecessary bloat to the system. This seems like a really interesting thing to me, even though I'll probably never touch it.
